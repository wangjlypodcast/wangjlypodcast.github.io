## 1st if i were you
if i were you, i stay home, keep my happiness which is too precious to lose. i will love my family and keep them well.

or, I take adventure to create a new world like i am young. i want to see the whole world, and find my final destiny, and 

while i feel tired, slow down, lay down, watch the blue sky, recall my life with my lover. what a beautiful life.
