##  What I should do
The situation is: -p
I am busy -p
I am bad in using this language-p
So, I can not make a big plan (maybe conceive some interesting episodes). maybe later, after I can use this language well and have enough time, I can do that.-p
Now ,I will focus on some news to review. I am sure I can use different view to commont them.-p
the first thing is about an incident happened in Sichuan Province, some people died in torrent in Pengzhou City.-p
Here is my commonents:-p
1, the video maker violated privacy right of the dead when she took that clip. and showed her cold feeling to the dead when she posted the clip online.-p
2, People always die like any other creature. It is a nature, I have no feeling about their death, and your mercy toward them might be meant cruel to creature -p
they killed, animals, vegetation. In my view, they are equal with their pray.-p
3, The government should do more than just criticizing people. the weather is so hot, people no better places to make them happy. No enough swimming pools, no enough -p
gym with air conditions, no enough public library or anything else can let people releif during this longer heat wave. the worst things is, the government-p 
forbid people to swimming in natural pool, take my city Hangzhou, we have a beautiful and big lake, west lake, but we are forbidden to swim in it. tens millions-p
people have to stay their home and using air condition to keep their body cool. It hurts both people and enviroment.-p
