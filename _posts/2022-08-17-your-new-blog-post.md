##  What I should do
The situation is　　
I am busy 　　
I am bad in using this language　　
So, I can not make a big plan (maybe conceive some interesting episodes). maybe later, after I can use this language well and have enough time, I can do that.　　
Now ,I will focus on some news to review. I am sure I can use different view to commont them.　　
the first thing is about an incident happened in Sichuan Province, some people died in torrent in Pengzhou City.　　
Here is my commonents:　　
1, the video maker violated privacy right of the dead when she took that clip. and showed her cold feeling to the dead when she posted the clip online.　　
2, People always die like any other creature. It is a nature, I have no feeling about their death, and your mercy toward them might be meant cruel to creature 　　
they killed, animals, vegetation. In my view, they are equal with their pray.　　
3, The government should do more than just criticizing people. the weather is so hot, people no better places to make them happy. No enough swimming pools, no enough 　　
gym with air conditions, no enough public library or anything else can let people releif during this longer heat wave. the worst things is, the government　　
forbid people to swimming in natural pool, take my city Hangzhou, we have a beautiful and big lake, west lake, but we are forbidden to swim in it. tens millions　　
people have to stay their home and using air condition to keep their body cool. It hurts both people and enviroment.
