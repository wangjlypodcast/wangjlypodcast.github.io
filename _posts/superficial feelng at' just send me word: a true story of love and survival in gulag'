Today, I sat at Zhejiang library, no idea what to do. I check email box and find nothing what i am interested in. suddenly, I recalled a stunned fiction about gulag, which

is a labour camp in soviet. the simple story is as following.

a young man lev was studied at a uni before the 2nd world war, then he joined the army, then arrested, then liberated by usa army and was invited to usa. but he refused

that offer because he had a relationship with a girl call sveta, who was possibly waiting for him in Russia. So he went back his homeland and was convicted as a defector  and was sent

to far north area inside arctic circle to serve his sentence, which is about 20 years.

His living enviroment was hard and dangerous, could die anytime. He was quite frustrated and felt humiliated for his situation, and did not contact anyone he knew. 

By the way, in that time , the gulags were a strong economical system in soviet republic. most of resources what war need produced from these places. because lev was a 

undergraduate before the second world war, he could do more thing in gulag. So he was getting better there, and restored some confidence to contact his relative and 

request informatoin about his girl after he lived gulag about 5 year later.

surprised to him, his friends, relatives and his girl friend paid great sympathy toward him, not disdained him as he thought before. So he worked harder hopefully to reduce

his sentence. and wrote letter to sveta. these letters violated the laws in soviet, but these people took a very large risk wrote ,sent ,kept these letter, which amounted to

thousands. 

there was a relative free period after stalin died. some western authors went to Russia to collect materials for their creation. these letters was regarded as the biggest

documents responded that era.

An English author wrote a story which is too real as a literature in my opinion. but it has the power to stun me.
